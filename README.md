# Car-Price-Prediction-Machine-Learning-by-Models
# Introduction
The Car Price Dataset is a comprehensive collection of vehicle specifications and their respective market prices. It is widely used in machine learning projects for price prediction, analysis, and understanding the factors affecting car valuation.

This dataset contains various attributes related to cars, including brand, model, engine specifications, mileage, horsepower, fuel type, and pricing details. By analyzing this data, we can build predictive models that estimate a car's price based on its features, helping businesses, dealerships, and consumers make informed decisions.
# Objective of Analysis
The primary objective of working with this dataset is to develop a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various attributes.

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car.
How well those variables describe the price of a car
# Implementing  the following five regression algorithms:
1) Linear Regression
2) Decision Tree Regressor
3) Random Forest Regressor
4) Gradient Boosting Regressor
5) Support Vector Regressor
